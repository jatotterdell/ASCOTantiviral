## Antiviral Criteria

For reference, the exclusion criteria for the anti-viral domain follows (note that since only two antiviral interventions were available, an intervention exclusion criteria becomes a domain exclusion criteria):

- Known current decompensated liver disease (Child-Pugh B or C) (`EL_DecompensatedLiver`)
- The treating clinician intends to continue or commence treatment with oral therapeutic anticoagulation agents such as warfarin/dabigatran/rivaroxaban for non COVID-19 related purposes. (`EL_OralTherapeuticAnticoagAgents`)
- A current or recurrent condition with a high risk of major bleeding (e.g. bleeding disorder), or a baseline coagulation profile (within the previous 3 days) that indicates a high risk of bleeding, that would be considered a contraindication to receive therapeutic anticoagulation. (`EL_TherapeuticAnticoagBleeding`)
- Serum Potassium >5.5 mmol/L (based on most recent blood test result collected as part of routine care within the previous 3 days) (`EL_SerumPotassium`)
- Serum Sodium <120 mmol/L (based on most recent blood test result collected as part of routine care within the previous 3 days). (`EL_SerumSodium`)
- Hypersensitivity to nafamostat (`EL_HyperNafamostat`)
- Pregnancy or breastfeeding (`EL_PregnancyBreastfeedingStatus`)
- Currently receiving or have received nafamostat in the past 7 days (`EL_ReceivedNafamostat`)
- Decompensated heart failure or renal dialysis and clinician believes an extra 500mL fluid/day would be detrimental (`EL_HeartRenalDialysis`)

## Anticoagulation Criteria

For reference, the exclusion criteria for the anti-coagulation domain follows (derived variable `EL_inelg_c`):

-  Receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (`EL_DualAntiplateletTherapy`)
-  The treating clinician intends to continue or commence therapeutic anticoagulation (`EL_TherapeuticAnticoag`)
-  Contraindication to receiving low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin (`EL_ContraHeparinReact`)
-  Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 30 x $10^9$/L \[protocol version 3.0\] or less than 50 x $10^9$/L \[protocol version 5.0\] (`EL_BloodPlateletTestAs_x10_9_L`)
-  History of intracranial haemorrhage in the previous 3 months (`EL_IntracranialHaemorrhage`)
-  Severe renal impairment, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 15ml/min/1.73m$^2$ (`EL_eGFR`)
-  A current or recurrent condition with a high risk of major bleeding (e.g. bleeding disorder), or a baseline coagulation profile (within the previous 3 days) that indicates a high risk of bleeding, that would be considered a contraindication to receive therapeutic anticoagulation (`EL_BleedingConditionThrombo`)
