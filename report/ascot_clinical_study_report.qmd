# Introduction

## Purpose

The trial steering committee (TSC) closed randomisation to the anticoagulation domain on 8 April 2022. The blinded statistical analysis working group prepared a statistical analysis plan (SAP) for reporting the results of the anticoagulation domain. The unblinded team of statisticians undertook the analyses using the relevant records as extracted from the database on 2022-06-06.

Subsequently, the TSC closed randomisation to the antiviral domain on X XXXX 2022.
The blinded statistical analysis group prepared a SAP for reporting the results of the antiviral domain.
Given all study domains have closed, the unblinded team of statisticians undertook final analyses using the relevant records as extracted from the database on 2022-10-xx

This report summarises the data and results of the analyses for the ascot trial. 
The report focuses on the antiviral domain but also reports on the anticoagulation domain for completeness sake.

## Interventions

There were two mutually exclusive interventions in the antiviral domain.
They were:

- no specific antiviral (standard of care, control)
- Nafamostat

There were four mutually exclusive interventions in the anticoagulation domain. 
They were:

- low-dose thromboprophylaxis (control)
- intermediate-dose thromboprophylaxis
- low-dose thromboprophylaxis with aspirin
- therapeutic-dose thromboprophylaxis

For full details of the interventions, refer to the domain specific appendices to the protocol.

## Outcomes

For details on the primary and secondary outcomes, refer to the core protocol. For details on the domain specific outcomes refer to the anticoagulation domain-specific appendix.

## Modelling

### General Considerations

All binary outcomes were analysed using a logistic regression model, ordinal outcomes by a cumulative logistic model with proportional odds, and the time to recovery outcome by a discrete-time competing-risk (death) time-to-event model (multinomial logistic regression). Weakly informative priors were specified for all models.

The (pre-specified) primary model for all outcomes included fixed terms for:

- anticoagulation intervention
- antiviral intervention
- intervention ineligibility
- age group (< 60, $\geq$ 60 years of age)
- oxygen requirement
- region of enrolment (India, Australia/New Zealand, Nepal)

Hierarchical terms were also included for:

- site of enrolment (nested within region)
- epoch of enrolment (4-week groupings)

Outcomes are coded such that an odds ratio less than 1 implies a decrease in the outcome, for example, lower odds of 28 day mortality, fewer days alive and free of hospital, etc. Therefore, depending on the outcome, an odds ratio less than 1 may imply benefit or harm, but this will be made clear for each outcome.

In general, the reference group (to which the model intercept(s) or baseline hazard applies) was taken to be a patient who was:

- randomised to the anticoagulation domain (equal weighting across all interventions)
- *not* randomised to the antiviral domain
- eligible for all anticoagulation interventions
- less than 60 years of age
- did not require supplemental oxygen
- enrolled in India during the most recent epoch

Bayesian models were computed using Stan via `cmdstanr` (0.5.2 and cmdstan version 2.30.1) in R (4.2.2). For each model, 8 chains were used with a warm-up of 1000 iterations and sampling for 2500 iterations per chain resulting in 20,000 posterior draws per model. Standard diagnostics were assessed for each model (divergent transitions, trace plots, R-hat). If an issue was identified (e.g. divergent transitions) then the default sampling parameters may have been adjusted (e.g. increasing target acceptance rate or increasing maximum tree depth). If any convergence issues resulted for the pre-specified models, then they are reported along with the model results. If the model was amended in any way to satisfy convergence criteria (e.g. aggregation of groups, removal of model terms) then this is reported in the relevant section. Sampling was run using a different (randomly selected) random seed for each model, and these were recorded for replication.

Due to the small number of enrolments at New Zealand sites, in models where country of enrolment were included as a term, Australia and New Zealand were combined into one region. The hierarchical site effects for centres in Australia and New Zealand were nested within this joint region rather than each country individually. For models where site was included as a random effect, sites with less than 5 participants were aggregated within region into an "other sites" grouping. Similarly, for models where epoch was included, epochs with less than 10 participants were aggregated with the adjacent epoch.

Missing outcome data were not imputed for any of the models (with the exception of the deterministic imputation used in the best-case/worst-case sensitivity analyses).
The only baseline covariate of interest which had missing values was oxygen requirement.
For the primary analyses, participants with missing information for oxygen requirement (25 participants in full analysis set) were assumed to have *not* required supplemental oxygen.

### Further Details

For all models, the primary linear predictor was the same. For a participant $i$ with outcome $y_i$, their region of enrolment is denoted by $r(i)\in\{1,...,R\}$, their site by $s(i)\in\{1,...,S_{r(i)}\}$, and their epoch by $t(i)\in\{1,...,T\}$. Their anticoagulation design vector is denoted by $x_{Ci}$ and their antiviral design vector by $x_{Ai}$, their aspirin ineligibility by $e_i$, their age group by $a_i$, and oxygen requirement $o_i$, so that
$$
\eta_i = x_{Ci}^{\mathsf{T}}\beta_C + x_{Ai}^{\mathsf{T}}\beta_A + \rho_{r(i)} + \xi_{r(i), s(i)} + \tau_{t(i)} + \omega_1e_i + \omega_2a_i + \omega_3 o_i,
$$
was the linear predictor for the outcome for participant $i$.

For all models, the prior distribution on the linear components were
$$
\begin{aligned}
  \beta_C &\overset{\text{iid}}{\sim} \text{Normal}(0, 1) \\
  \beta_A &\overset{\text{iid}}{\sim} \text{Normal}(0, 1) \\
  \rho_1 = 0, \rho_r &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 1), \quad r=2,...,R \\
  \tau_1 = 0, \tau_t &\sim \text{Normal}(\tau_{t-1}, \sigma_\tau^2), \quad t=2,...,T \\
  \sigma_\tau &\sim \text{Student-}t(3, 0, 1) \\
  \xi_{r,s} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_{\xi_r}^2),\quad s=1,...,S_r,\quad r=1,...,R \\
  \sigma_{\xi_r} &\sim \text{Student-}t(3, 0, 1),\quad r=1,...,R \\
  \omega_1 &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 10^2) \\
  \omega_2 &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5^2) \\
  \omega_3 &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5^2).
\end{aligned}
$$

For **binary outcomes**, $y_i\in\{0,1\}$, the model was
$$
\begin{aligned}
\pi(\eta) &= \text{logit}^{-1}(\beta_0 + \eta) \\
y_i &\sim \text{Bernoulli}(\pi(\eta_i))
\end{aligned}
$$
with $\beta_0 \sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5^2)$.

For **ordinal outcomes** with $K$ levels, $y_i\in\{1,...,K\}$, the model was
$$
\begin{aligned}
\pi_{k}(\eta) &= \begin{cases}
1 - \text{logit}^{-1}(\eta - \alpha_1) & k=1 \\
\text{logit}^{-1}(\eta - \alpha_{k-1}) - \text{logit}^{-1}(\eta - \alpha_{k}) & k=2,...,K-1 \\
\text{logit}^{-1}(\eta - \alpha_{K-1}) & k=K
\end{cases} \\
y_i &\sim \text{Categorical}(\pi_k(\eta_i))
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\alpha_k < \alpha_{k+1}$ for $k\in\{1,...,K-2\}$ and $\pi(0) \sim \text{Dirichlet}(2/K, \cdots, 2/K)$.

For the **time-to-clinical-recovery outcome**, where $d_i\in\{1,...,28\}$ denotes the day of first event (or censoring at day 28) and $m\in\{0,1,2\}$ indicates event types (unrecovered, recovered, died), and $y_{id}=(y_{id0}, y_{id1}, y_{id2})$ with $y_{itm}\in\{0,1\}$ indicates the status of patient $i$ at day $d\leq d_i$, then the model was
$$
\begin{aligned}
\lambda_m(d,\eta) &= \frac{\exp(\alpha_{dm} + \eta_m)}{1 + \sum_{l=1}^M \exp(\alpha_{dl} + \eta_l)},\quad m=1,2 \\
y_{id} &\sim \text{Multinomial}\left(1, \left(1 - \sum_{l=1}^2\lambda_l(d, \eta_i), \lambda_1(d,\eta_i), \lambda_2(d,\eta_i)\right)\right),\quad d\leq d_i,
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\eta = (\eta_1, \eta_2)$ contains the event-specific linear predictors with event-specific parameters in the same structure as previously introduced, and with priors
$$
\begin{aligned}
\alpha_{1m} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 10^2) \\
\alpha_{dm} &\sim \text{Normal}(\alpha_{d-1,m}, \sigma_\alpha^2)
\end{aligned}, \quad m=1,2,
$$
on the event-specific baseline-hazard terms.

## Trial Decision Criteria

As per the statistical appendix to the core protocol, the following decision quantities were of interest in the anticoagulation domain for the primary outcome model:

- **Superiority**: superiority was assessed using the posterior probability that the intervention has the lowest odds of the outcome amongst all interventions in the domain. If a single intervention had probability exceeding 0.99 superiority would be triggered for that intervention.
- **Effectiveness**: effectiveness was assessed relative to the low-dose arm as the posterior probability that the intervention reduces the odds of the outcome. If any intervention had probability exceeding 0.99 then effectiveness would be triggered for that intervention.
- **Futility**: futility was assessed relative to the low-dose arm as the posterior probability that the intervention reduces the odds of the outcome by no more than a factor of 1/1.1. If any intervention had probability exceeding 0.95 than futility would be triggered for that intervention.
- **Equivalence**: equivalence was assessed relative to the low-dose arm as the posterior probability that the intervention alters the odds of the outcome by a factor bounded by (1/1.1, 1.1).

# Results

## Study Population

### Summary

At the time of database lock for the antiviral domain, 1,606 participants had been enrolled onto the study platform.
Of these enrolees, 1,574 were randomised to the anticoagulation domain and 159 were randomised to the antiviral domain (127 to both domains, 32 to antiviral only, and 1,447 to anticoagulation only).
The first participant was randomised on 2021-02-08, the last participant enrolled into the anticoagulation domain was randomised on 2022-03-29, and the last participant enrolled into the antiviral domain was randomised on 2022-08-04.

From the 1,606 enrolled participants, 18 withdrew consent for follow-up, leaving 1,588 participants with expected follow-up.

### Disposition

Of the 1,606 participants randomised to the trial, 18 withdrew consent for follow-up (16 on study day 1 and 2 on study day 2) leaving 1,588 participants continuing to study day 28. The analyses and summaries included in this report exclude data on participants who withdrew consent for follow-up.

Platform and domain specific flow diagrams is shown in in @fig-combined-flow-anticoagulation and  @fig-combined-flow-antiviral.

![Combined domain flowchart for antiviral.](combined_antiviral_flowchart.tex){#fig-combined-flow-antiviral}

@fig-enrolments presents overall platform enrolments by calendar time with timing of intervention availabilities and interim analyses. Due to an insufficient number of participants on the therapeutic anticoagulation arm, the initial allocation ratios were not changed during recruitment to the anticoagulation domain. Therefore, the only trial adaptations which occurred were the cessation of the standard dose plus aspirin intervention in the anticoagulation domain, the opening of the antiviral domain, and the introduction of the therapeutic dose intervention into the anticoagulation domain. Despite this, the timing of interim analyses are indicated on the Figures.

### Intervention Allocations

Response adaptive randomisation (RAR) was never activated in the anticoagulation domain. This was due to the therapeutic intervention never exceeding the minimum sample size of 50, and the fixed allocation to control. Therefore, target allocations to the interventions were uniform across all available interventions from trial start to trial closure. However, the available interventions did change over time and availability varied by region and site. Similarly, RAR was never activated in the antiviral domain due to insufficient sample size. 

The following figures summarise treatment allocations by country, site, and calendar time.

### Compliance

There were two participants who received the wrong dosage (according to the antiviral domain specific appendix) on at least one day given their baseline weight:

- One participant reportedly had 3 days of 500 mg/day instead of 350 mg/day (baseline weight of 65 kg). 
This participant was determined to not be per-protocol.
- Another participant reportedly had 2 days of 350 mg/day instead of 250 mg/day (baseline weight of 60 kg).
This participant was determined to be per-protocol.

@fig-naf-duration presents the distribution of Nafamostat infusion duration for each study day amongst participants assigned to receive Nafamostat. 
@tbl-compliance presents summaries of treatment compliance for participants assigned to Nafamostat.

## Primary Outcome

### Descriptive

The primary outcome is a composite comprised of:

-   day 28 mortality
-   vasopressor/inotropic support within first 28 days
-   new intensive respiratory support within first 28 days.

The definition also allowed for patients who had unknown day 28 status, but were discharged against medical advice (DAMA) and designated as likely to die within 28 days. 
However, no participants met this criteria (all cases of DAMA and likely to die within 28 days had known day 28 status).

The proportion of participants who met the primary outcome, and rates of missingness, are reported in @tbl-primary-composite-summary-anticoagulation and @tbl-primary-composite-summary-antiviral. 

A breakdown of the composite, including missingness by component is reported for ACS-ITT and AVS-ITT in @tbl-primary-composite-breakdown-anticoagulation and @tbl-primary-composite-breakdown-antiviral respectively. 
Missingness was predominantly due to unknown patient status at study day 28.

A summary of the primary outcome by each of the baseline covariates pre-specified to be included in the primary model (or as pre-specified subgroup analyses) are presented in the appendix (@sec-app-primary-outcome-model-cov).

### Primary Analysis

The primary model was a logistic regression model adjusting for anticoagulation treatment, antiviral treatment, age ($\geq 60$ or not), oxygen requirement (required supplemental oxygen or not), and region (India (ref), Australia/New Zealand, and Nepal), with random effects for site (nested within country) and epoch (calendar time 4 week intervals, most recent epoch as reference). The three most recent epochs were combined due to small numbers, and the two earliest epochs were combined for the same reason. Sites with fewer than 5 enrolments were combined within region into an "other sites" category. The primary analysis was based on the FAS-ITT set using the full model as specified in the statistical appendix to the core protocol.  An odds ratio less than 1 implies a benefit (reduction in the odds of primary outcome).

#### FAS-ITT

- **Model**: logistic regression
- **Terms**: anticoagulation intervention, antiviral intervention, aspirin eligibility, age group, oxygen requirement, region, site nested within region, and epoch
- **Set**: FAS-ITT

The trial decision quantities are reported in @tbl-primary-model-fas-itt-decision and the model parameter posteriors are summarised in @tbl-primary-model-fas-itt-summary and @fig-primary-model-fas-itt-site-epoch-parameters.

#### AVS-ITT

The SAP pre-specified that the primary model would be fit using the AVS-ITT including all the pre-specified covariates.
This analyses deviated from that specified in the SAP for a number of reasons:

- almost all in AVS-ITT were enrolled in Australia/New Zealand, so region was dropped
- concurrent randomisation to antiviral domain (where available) throughout entire study, so epoch term dropped
- other covariates dropped due to small number of cases and events.

Therefore, the analysis restricted to the AVS-ITT set was based on a antiviral treatment only model.
Due to the small number of events, the parameter posteriors will be sensitive to the priors.

In summary, the analysis was based on the following:

- **Model**: logistic regression
- **Terms**: antiviral intervention
- **Set**: AVS-ITT

<!-- ### Subgroups -->

<!-- The pre-specified subgroups where treatment effect heterogeneity was to be investigated were: -->

<!-- -   region (India, Australia/New Zealand, Nepal) -->
<!-- -   days since symptom onset ($\leq 7$ or $> 7$ days) -->
<!-- -   age at enrolment ($<60$ or $\geq 60$ years of age) -->
<!-- -   supplemental oxygen or oxygen saturation less than 94% at randomisation (yes or no) -->
<!-- -   receipt of corticosteroid during hospital stay (yes or no) -->
<!-- -   receipt of remdesivir during hospital stay (yes or no) -->
<!-- -   receipt of other agent intended to be antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 during hospital stay (yes or no) -->

<!-- Domain-specific subgroups were additionally specified as: -->

<!-- -   weight ($< 120$ or $\geq 120$ kg) -->
<!-- -   patient on aspirin at baseline (yes or no) -->
<!-- -   D-dimer above upper limit of normal at baseline (yes or no) -->

<!-- For each sub-group analysis, the primary model was extended to include an interaction term between the covariate of interest and the anticoagulation interventions. In some cases, there may be no information on the subgroup-specific effect (for example, there were no participants in Nepal who were randomised to receive standard dose plus aspirin), but the results are reported in such cases noting that the posterior is driven by the prior. -->

<!-- In these subgroup analyses, the reference group was generally taken to be the largest subgroup and the intervention effect in this reference group has a normal prior with mean 0 and standard deviation 2.5. For each additional subgroup, the interaction between each intervention and subgroup level has a normal prior with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. -->

<!-- \clearpage -->

<!-- #### Region -->

<!-- A subgroup analysis of region is undertaken using the ACS-ITT set. A summary of the primary outcome by country and intervention is reported in @tbl-descriptive-acs-itt-subgroup-region. Note that no participants enrolled in Nepal or New Zealand received standard dose plus aspirin due to the timing of its removal from the domain. Despite this, an interaction term for region and standard dose plus aspirin was retained in the model, however, the associated effect (in Nepal) corresponds to the assumed prior given there is little to no data available. -->

<!-- #### Sensitivity: Concurrent Randomisations -->

<!-- In the following section, analyses are undertaken where the analysis set is restricted to participants who were randomised concurrently amongst the interventions of interest. Three sets are considered, one for each intervention. Given that the intermediate and standard dose interventions were available the entire time the anticoagulation domain was open, that analysis set is restricted to only participants randomised to one of those interventions. The other sets are determined by either a patients calendar time of randomisation or the protocol version under which they were enrolled. Given that RAR was not activated in the domain, the epoch terms are removed from these models as the intervention availability is the only factor varying the allocation probabilities. Additionally, due to smaller sample sizes, site terms and antiviral intervention terms have been dropped from the models. For the definitions of the analysis sets, refer to @sec-analysis-sets. -->

## Secondary Outcomes

For all secondary outcomes, the primary model (the model adjusting for interventions, age group, country, site, and epoch using the relevant outcome model) was fit to the ACS-ITT set. The only sensitivity analysis conducted was to repeat the analyses restricted to contemporaneous controls using a reduced model.

### Time to clinical recovery to day 28

This section reports on the analysis for time to clinical recovery. Time to clinical recovery was taken as the first day from the index admission at which the patient had a WHO outcome score of 3 or less. For participants whose WHO outcome score was greater than 3 on the day of discharge, their day of recovery was counted as the first day after discharge, e.g. if discharged on day 7 with a daily WHO score of 4, then time to recovery was quantified as 8. Death was treated as a competing-risk to recovery. If recovery and death reportedly occurred on the same day (e.g. daily status WHO scale < 4 but discharge outcome of death on same day), then the patient was considered to have died on that day without recovery. No adjustment was made for participants who recovered but then subsequently died (i.e. only the first event was considered; any such patients were just counted as recovered on the relevant day). No allowance was made for participants who discharged against medical advice (treated as recovered following discharge).

The analysis of the time to clinical recovery to day 28 outcome used a discrete-time competing risk time-to-event model (multinomial logistic regression). The events of interest were death or recovery. Baseline cause-specific hazards were modelled separately for death and recovery with some smoothing enforced across adjacent time points via a first order random walk prior on the logit intercept terms.

This modelling approach deviated from that specified in the SAP which did not account for the competing risk of death.

This section reports on the analysis of the secondary outcome: WHO outcome scale at day 28. The model is coded so that an odds ratio less than 1 implies a benefit (reduction in odds of having a higher WHO score at day 28).

#### FAS-ITT

- **Model**: cumulative logistic (ordinal) regression assuming proportional odds
- **Terms**: anticoagulation intervention, antiviral intervention, aspirin eligibility, age group, region, site nested within region, and epoch.
- **Set**: FAS-ITT

@tbl-7-2-summary-anticoagulation presents the number of participants where the outcome was observed by the allocated anticoagulation arm. Similarly for the antiviral arms in @tbl-7-2-summary-antiviral. @fig-7-2-anticoagulation and @fig-7-2-antiviral report on the distribution of day 28 WHO score.

The model parameters (odds ratios) are summarised in @tbl-7-2-primary-model-fas-itt-summary for the fixed-effect terms and in @fig-7-2-primary-model-fas-itt-site-epoch-parameters for the site and epoch specific terms.

### All-cause mortality to day 28

This section reports on the analysis of the secondary outcome: all-cause mortality to day 28. For this outcome, participants who died within 28 days were coded to have a value of 1, and those who did not, to have a value of 0. The model is coded so that an odds ratio less than 1 implies a benefit (reduction in odds of death by day 28).

#### FAS-ITT

- **Model**: logistic regression
- **Terms**: anticoagulation intervention, antiviral intervention, aspirin eligibility, age group, oxygen requirement, region, site nested within region, and epoch.
- **Set**: FAS-ITT

<!-- @tbl-7-3-summary presents the number of participants where the outcome was observed by the allocated anticoagulation arm. The model parameters (odds ratios) are summarised in @tbl-7-3-primary-model-acs-itt-summary for the fixed-effect terms and in @fig-7-3-primary-model-acs-itt-site-epoch-parameters for the site and epoch specific terms. -->

<!-- The proportion who had died by day 28 was 3.3% (50 / 1530) amongst all randomised participants. Compared with standard dose, the median adjusted odds ratios (95% CrI) from the primary model were: 0.84 (0.41, 1.67) for intermediate dose, 0.82 (0.36, 1.81) for standard dose plus aspirin, and 3.16 (0.95, 10.5) for therapeutic dose. The corresponding posterior probabilities for effectiveness were 0.69, 0.69 and 0.03 respectively.   -->

### Days alive and free of hospital to day 28

This section reports on the analysis of the secondary outcome: days alive and free of hospital (DAFH) to day 28. For this outcome, participants who died within 28 days were coded to have 0 DAFH. The model is coded so that an odds ratio greater than 1 implies a benefit (increased odds of more days alive and free of hospital).

@tbl-7-4-summary-anticoagulation presents the number of participants where the outcome was observed by the allocated anticoagulation arm. Similarly, @tbl-7-4-summary-antiviral for the antiviral domain. 
The observed distribution of DAFH by domain treatment arm is shown in @fig-7-4-descriptive-anticoagulation, @fig-7-4-descriptive-anticoagulation2, @fig-7-4-descriptive-antiviral and @fig-7-4-descriptive-antiviral2.

## Domain Specific Outcomes

### Antiviral Domain

The antiviral domain-specific outcomes were:

- viral clearance at days 3 and 7
- viral load at days 3 and 7
- safety:
  - elevation of Alanine Transaminase (ALT) or Aspartate Transaminase (AST)
  - elevation of serum potassium
  - decrease of serum sodium
  - major bleeding as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)
  - clinically relevant non-major bleeding (as defined by the ISTH)
  - thrombophlebitis/vasculitis at IV line site

The SAP specifies that descriptive summaries are to be reported for the antiviral specific outcomes.

<!-- ### Anticoagulation Domain -->

<!-- The anticoagulation domain-specific outcomes are reported in @tbl-8-0-acs-itt-summary. The number of thrombotic and bleeding events were low across all interventions and overall. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- #| label: tbl-8-0-acs-itt-summary -->

<!-- #| results: asis -->
<!-- tab <- readLines(file.path("..", "outputs", "tables", "outcomes", "secondary", "8-0-anticoagulation-specific-summary.tex")) -->
<!-- writeLines(tab) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The SAP described a formal analysis of the two composite outcomes: any thrombotic event (or death), and any clinical relevant bleeding. Due to the small number of bleeding events this analysis was not undertaken. Similarly, for any thrombotic event or death, due to the majority of the events being due to death, the results were expected to be similar to those for all-cause mortality to day 28. Despite this, the analysis *was* performed for any thrombotic event or death and the results reported below. -->
